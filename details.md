“Care, We Surely Care”: Inside Ofure Home for the Elderly’s Caregiver‑Training Institute

Where Compassion Meets Professional Skill
Ofure Home for the Elderly began as an act of simple devotion: “We love to care for every individual—young or old,” says founder Mrs Philomena Isiramen. Built on the same faith‑driven ethos that powers Ofure Orphanage, the institute turns that passion into structured, government‑recognized training for caregivers across Nigeria.

Vision: Raising Global‑Ready Caregivers
The program’s goal is two‑fold:

For Students – instill love, patience, empathy and professional know‑how so graduates can confidently support babies, the disabled, post‑natal mothers and—most urgently—the elderly.

For Society – supply families, hospitals and employers (local and international) with caregivers whose skills match their compassion.

Graduates leave equipped to “care for his or her home… and even to go out of the country and get a job.”

What Makes the Program Stand Out

Aspect	How Ofure Delivers
Dual‑track Learning	Hospital‑based practicums plus in‑class theory.
Comprehensive Scope	No specialization silos: trainees cover the full lifespan—from pediatric to geriatric care.
Accelerated Timeline	Three‑month course → revision & hospital practicum → government‑set exam.
Government Certification	External examiners issue certificates recognized in Nigeria and abroad.
